According to tradition, Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662 was hidden within the hollow of the tree to thwart its confiscation by the English governor-general. The oak became a symbol of American independence.   In addition to appearing on the commmemorated state quarter, in 1935, for Connecticut's tercentennial, it was also depicted on both a commemorative half dollar and a postage stamp."
